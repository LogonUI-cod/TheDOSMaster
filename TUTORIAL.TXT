                                                     ##WARNING#
    Don't use this on a WIN9X system or else it will not run properly, it might corrupt DOS\HIMEM.SYS, DOS\AUTOEXEC.BAT, TERMINAL\pak
    Run the batch at your OWN RISK!
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    To install, Run setup.bat with /himem=60 /cpulevel={your level} /noerror /nodetect
    if you don't run with /himem=60 your computer will be VERY SLOW!
